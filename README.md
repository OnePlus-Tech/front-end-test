Front-end Code Test
==============

Congratulations! We like your application and think you are a promising candidate. There's one more step to determine if you have the technical chops to come help us change the world. We have a small task to test your ability to work with our most used tools and your general front-end knowledge.

Imagine that it's your first day at OnePlus and your first task is to help us to improve our homepage. You should add a block of accessories and banners to the website before the footer element. Additionally you should improve responsiveness of the page. In the folder "images_from_designer" you can find the images you need to complete the test.

We are using sass syntax with compass preprocessor and bootstrap 3 css framework.

You're received base-system files, mockups from designer and part of OnePlus guidelines.

There's no specific deadline for this task.

Looking forward for your results!
